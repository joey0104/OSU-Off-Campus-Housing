# OSU-off-campus-housing
This website is developed to advance efficiency in student's search for suitable apartments and roommates
## Description
This website is assembled with Python, CSS, and HTML, incorporating with flask_sqlalchemy, flask, and techniques, including webscpraing and more. To utilize the website, users are required to create an account, providing basic information and a brief bio to enhance their experience. The webiste collects housing posts from the official OSU off-campus housing website. A filter function is implemented for efficiency. Additionally, users are allowed to create housing and sublease posts of their own. A "like" function is implemented for user's future reference. Moreover, a "liked" list will be generated with liked users' names and links to their profile, enabling users to identify potential roommates who have expressed interest in the same house.
## Inspiration
Finding roommates and apartments could be aggravating and strenuous. The primary concern I observed and aimed to target was the limited channels, merely Facebook, enabling students to search for roommates and post subleases. Therefore, I intended to develop this platform to alleviate the procress of finding new home and roommates. 
## Installation
Use the package manager pip to install:
  * beautifulSoup4 for web-scraping
  * Flask for website development
  * sqlalchemy for database usage (flask_sqlalchemy)
  * uuid for unique image address
